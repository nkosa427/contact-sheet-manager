# Project Brief: Contact Sheet Manager

## Core Goal

To provide a simple graphical user interface (GUI) tool for efficiently sorting video files based on associated contact sheet images (screenshots).

## Key Requirements

-   Allow users to select a root folder containing video files and a corresponding `customScreens_` subfolder with image files.
-   Display the contact sheet images one by one.
-   Enable users to categorize the video/image pair using keyboard shortcuts ('a', 'f', 'r').
-   Move the categorized files into designated subfolders within a `keep` directory.
-   Provide an option to play the associated video file using an external player.
-   Support drag-and-drop for folder selection.
-   Log application activity and errors.
